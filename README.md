# Our Data 
### Energy Sources/Output in the US

Our data encompasses the monthly energy output by source and quantity per State in the US. Our dataset
will allow users to discern trends and information from nation wide energy output data from 2021.
Please find the .csv file as well as the meta data in the data directory. 

## What questions can we answer with this data?
1. What percentage of renewable vs nonrenewable energy is being created within the US in 2021?
    * Can be answered with: Sum of all states overall energy use and the the sum of all states renewable energy use. 
2. Is there an overall upward trend towards renewable energy across the states?
    * Can be answered by: comparing the quarterly outputs of all state's renewable energy use across all catagories of renewable energy  
 
3. How does Minnesota compare to other states in terms of renewable sources?
 * Can be answered by: comparing Minnesota's renewable energy use to other states
4. Do different geographic areas trend towards certain energy sources?
 * Can be answered by: adding up the total amounts of energy use by type for states in a certain region and comparing this number for each region 

## User Roles:

1. Climate Scientist

As a Climate Scientist, we can assume their goal is to reduce harmful emission into the atmosphere by
prioritizing renewable sources of energy, while their task when visiting our website would be to gather 
data on current emissions in the US. They would arguably be interested in all the above questions, but 
they would be most concerned with #1,2 because they are most related to their tasks as a Climate Scientist.

2. Politician

As a Politician, we can assume their goal is to make them and their platform look as positive as possible.
If they want to appear progressive and get re-elected, their goal will be to gather data to support their
campaign. They would definitely be interested in #3 (assuming they are a Minnesota politician) and #2 because
they will want to show their progress. Their task coming to this site would be to gather data from our site.

3. Social Activist

As a Social Activist, we can assume their goal is to raise awareness of the ongoing climate crisis and promote
renewable sources of energy. Their task on our site would be to gather data on harmful emissions and positive
renewable energy trends. As such, they would be most interested in #1,2 because they are more sweeping and general questions.
